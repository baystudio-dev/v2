## CP16 Android E2E • PARTIAL
- ✅ [x] New single Bash-process emulator runner script and mocked success/negative tests in scripts/qa/android-ci-smoke-contract.test.js.
- ✅ [x] Isolated Android build helper checks Java 17, SDK36, NDK27 and CMake3.22.1: scripts/qa/build-android-debug.sh.
- ✅ [x] CI 37778072039 builds and zipaligns ARM64 and x86_64 APKs successfully.
- ⛔ [ ] Local Gradle build blocked by missing/unlicensed Build Tools 35.0.0.
- ⛔ [ ] CI run 37805223698: APK installed but Activity startup timed out; port 3000 did not respond after 90 health probes. Continuous logcat capture added, awaiting next CI.
- ✅ [x] **CI 37878367182 PASS:** Desktop, ARM64/x86_64 build, APK zipalign 16 KiB, Android API 36 x86_64 emulator, actual `/api/status` HTTP response. Evidence: checkpoints/CP16/RUNTIME_PASS_37878367182.md.
- ✅ [x] Rootfs `/bin/sh` guest-absolute symlink guard shared by Alpine and PRoot; Android `agent/` assets bundled; KVM-enabled CI; 26/26 contract QA passing.
- ⛔ [ ] CI 37885599280 restart gate failed with code 23: Android delivered the relaunch to a stale top Activity instead of starting a new process. Evidence: checkpoints/CP16/RESTART_FAILURE_37885599280.md.
- ⛔ [ ] CI 37887122479: restart launch blocked by Android 36 unsupported `--activity-new-task` option (script exit 26); not an application crash. Report: checkpoints/CP16/RESTART_FAILURE_37885599280.md.
- ⛔ [ ] CI 37887560726 blocked **before emulator boot**: /dev/kvm permissions unavailable immediately after udev refresh. KVM fallback and permission retries added to CI.
- ✅ [x] Android emulator **cold restart gate PASS** in CI 37887912549: fresh UI+engine PIDs, second `/api/status`, read-only `/api/team`, and no app fatal exception in captured log. Evidence: checkpoints/CP16/RESTART_PASS_37887912549.md.
- ✅ [x] **CI 37889374776 PASS:** Android 36 emulator read-only chat and workstation API, HTTP terminal execution rejected with 409. Evidence: checkpoints/CP16/READONLY_API_PASS_37889374776.md. Native PRoot terminal and agents still NOT TESTED.
- ⛔ [ ] CI 37890582657: native PRoot smoke blocked by harness library-path discovery (exit 40), before Linux execution; Android dumpsys returned legacyNativeLibraryDir instead of nativeLibraryDir.
- ⛔ [ ] CI 37891194307: PRoot binary path found but nested adb/run-as/env invocation dropped executable argument (env: exec -0). Exit 41; Alpine shell NOT YET VERIFIED.
- ⛔ [ ] CI 37891827332: stdin-fed PRoot app-UID shell failed with empty stderr, exit 41; no proof the guest executable ran.
- ⛔ [ ] CI 37892321937: run-as stdin confirmed, app UID u0_a150 confirmed, PRoot binary/loader and Alpine BusyBox all executable. Native PRoot exits without shell output (code 41 from harness). Real PRoot execution remains BLOCKED.
- 🟡 [ ] Added PRoot verbose (-v 9) and native exit code reporting for next emulator run; 29/29 local QA baseline expected; no workaround that weakens security.
- ⬜ [ ] Extended lifecycle endurance and physical ARM64 interactive chat/terminal/agent verification (**NOT TESTED**).
- ⬜ [ ] ARM64 physical device installs and runs chat/runtime tests (**NOT TESTED**).

- [x] Synthetic chat persistence gate implemented: real desktop backend survives three SIGKILL restarts; five exact messages, quoted/voice-note metadata, unrelated room and context checks. Evidence: checkpoints/CP16/CHAT_PERSISTENCE_GATE_20261013.md.
- [x] **CI 38369849285 PASS**: Android 36 x86_64 chat persistence after force-stop; five exact messages preserved; production PRoot and four instrumentation tests retained. Desktop baseline **43/43 PASS**. Evidence: checkpoints/CP16/CHAT_PERSISTENCE_GATE_20261013.md.
- [ ] Interrupted-write, full-disk and power-loss durability not verified. Physical ARM64 remains NOT TESTED.

- [x] Atomic chat snapshot implementation and explicit pre/post-commit storage errors: **67/67 local tests PASS**, including real SIGKILL at four write boundaries and disposable HTTP syscall-fault tests. Evidence: checkpoints/CP16/ATOMIC_CHAT_STORAGE_20261013.md.
- [x] **CI 38394270851: 4/4 PASS**, desktop **67/67**, Android 36 x86_64 atomic writer/cold-restart chat persistence, production PRoot, four instrumentation tests. Evidence: checkpoints/CP16/ATOMIC_CHAT_STORAGE_20261013.md.
- [ ] Real power-loss, physically full Android storage, and physical ARM64 runtime remain NOT TESTED. Windows/non-local FS, multi-process writers and whole-request transactions are not validated.

- [x] Opt-in inert message retry receipts implemented in the same atomic snapshot: local baseline **84/84 PASS**, including real post-commit/pre-ack SIGKILL and retry proof. Evidence: checkpoints/CP16/MESSAGE_RETRY_RECEIPTS_20261013.md.
- [x] **CI 38399249491 PASS**: desktop 84/84 and Android 36 keyed replay count=3 after restart; original five messages, production PRoot and four terminal tests preserved. Evidence: checkpoints/CP16/MESSAGE_RETRY_RECEIPTS_20261013.md.
- [ ] UI persisted keys, triggered-agent idempotency, auth and safe receipt retention/migration remain unimplemented; bounded 2048-receipt capacity has no automatic eviction.

- [x] Loopback HTTP boundary implemented: validated Host/peer/source/media type before routes, 111/111 local tests. Old hostile-Host reflection and text/plain mutation reproduced and then rejected. Evidence: checkpoints/CP16/LOCAL_HTTP_BOUNDARY_20261013.md.
- [x] **CI 38406779812 PASS**: desktop 111/111 and Android 13 rejected HTTP contexts with native/same-origin positive controls; chat/retry, production PRoot and four instrumentation tests retained. Evidence: checkpoints/CP16/LOCAL_HTTP_BOUNDARY_20261013.md.
- [ ] Native/CLI no-Origin compatibility is NOT authentication; per-room capabilities, same-origin XSS prevention and UI retry integration remain separate gates.

### CP16 ARM64 physical-linker follow-up (2026-10-16)
- ✅ [x] Rebuilt matched ARM64 PRoot + talloc candidate + guest loader from hash-pinned upstream sources; 16 KiB LOAD alignment verified for all three ELFs. Evidence: `checkpoints/CP16/ARM64_NATIVE_LINKER_FIX_20261016.md`.
- ✅ [x] Desktop regression 133/133 PASS, Gradle ARM64 `lintDebug assembleDebug` BUILD SUCCESSFUL; packaged APK inspected and SHA-256 recorded. Verified x86_64 bytes unchanged.
- ⬜ [ ] Real device ARM64 linker fix, PRoot `--help`, Alpine guest execution and agent roundtrip **NOT YET VERIFIED**. Build is a test candidate only.

### CP16 Android UI interaction QA continuation (2026-10-16)
- ✅ [x] Native WindowInsets root + terminal dialog respect status, cutout, gesture navigation and IME without double WebView safe-area application. Source: MainActivity.kt, TerminalOverlayDialog.kt, web/mobile-touch-insets.css.
- ✅ [x] Removed redundant floating terminal FAB covering Send/Mic, fixed landscape terminal Close overflow and unsupported inert controls.
- ✅ [x] WhatsApp-style configurable Enter/newline, IME composition protection, stable per-chat drafts and HTTP-acknowledged send, long-press context menu and Back behavior.
- ✅ [x] 142/142 local source contracts PASS; browser fixture interaction tests PASS on five viewport configurations with zero JavaScript errors. Evidence: checkpoints/CP16/WHATSAPP_MOBILE_INTERACTIONS_20261016.md.
- ⬜ [ ] Real ARM64 status/navigation bar, Gboard, clickability, rotation, Back gesture, model agent, and terminal runtime still require device QA. Simulated voice recording and unverified E2EE wording must not be called parity.

## CP17 Personal release
- ⬜ [ ] Personal APK, source ZIP, SBOM/licenses, no credentials and clean history.

## CP18 V1 feature parity • PARTIAL
- ✅ [x] 26 social feature items inventoried: checkpoints/CP18/PARITY_MATRIX.md.
- ✅ [x] 15 source symbols protected by scripts/qa/team-http.test.js contract.
- ✅ [x] Original web/app.js, web/index.html, MainActivity.kt checksums unchanged at first checkpoint.
- ⬜ [ ] Golden screenshot and interactive Android regression across 26 items.

## CP19 Zovia persona and rooms • PARTIAL
- ✅ [x] Architect persona in personas/zovia/PERSONA.md.
- ✅ [x] Four-person registry + stable legacy room names in agent/team-registry.js.
- ✅ [x] Room deny rules and migration helpers, unit tests.
- ✅ [x] GET /api/team metadata-only and 409 for unsupported direct_zovia messages.
- ✅ [x] Separate private room store with file permissions, idempotency, atomic replace.
- ✅ [x] Dedicated private-room-store.test.js tests prove restart, deny, tamper and symlink handling.
- ⬜ [ ] Authenticated per-room live endpoint and fully integrated storage.
- ⬜ [ ] Real Zovia engine, chat UI and mobile device E2E.

## CP20 Structured agent actions • PARTIAL
- ✅ [x] Validated pending mention/delegate/share action schema and in-memory idempotency in agent/action-protocol.js.
- ✅ [x] Reject cross-room mention/delegation and block share for future owner consent; scripts/qa/action-protocol.test.js.
- ⬜ [ ] Persist actions in durable journal and emit trusted execution receipt (not a fake success).
- ⬜ [ ] Real event receipt proves action executed, no simulated done.
- ⬜ [ ] Owner approval for cross-room sharing and safe retry.

## CP21 Selective context
- ⬜ [ ] Principal-scoped ContextPack, signed share receipts, revoke.
- ⬜ [ ] Private chat content never enters another room implicitly.

## CP22 Status/media/voice parity
- ⬜ [ ] Status 24h, native media, quotes, voice and golden snapshots.

## CP23 Multiagent & evidence
- ⬜ [ ] 3-agent isolated worktrees, no racing writes, evidence-gated claims.

## CP24 Final QA and release
- ⬜ [ ] P0 tests, corrected unsupported E2EE claim, personal APK and safe migration.

## Last verified status
- Local baseline tests: **26/26 PASS**.
- Latest verified recovery run **37887912549**: Desktop, ARM64/x86_64 build, Android 36 x86_64 initial boot + force-stop + cold restart with new UI/engine PIDs and healthy HTTP **PASS**. Evidence: checkpoints/CP16/RESTART_PASS_37887912549.md.
- CP16 remains **PARTIAL** pending physical ARM64 device tests and full application feature parity/long-running runtime QA.
- Zovia execution and Antigravity: NOT CONNECTED.
- User privacy: legacy API still returns all old chats to local client; must introduce auth before exposing new private room.

- ⛔ CP16 CI 37892838996: PRoot native exit 139 (suspected SIGSEGV) after app-UID binary checks. DT_NEEDED includes libtalloc_v2.so and libandroid-shmem.so; harness now mirrors production LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Emulator confirmation PENDING.

- ⛔ CP16 CI 37893656722: PRoot still exits 139 even with LD_LIBRARY_PATH set. Native crash buffer collection added for next run. PRoot remains blocked.

- ⛔ CP16 **CI 37911832910**: native PRoot `--help` (no Alpine launch) exits 139. This isolates failure to executable startup/native dependencies before PRoot guest execution. Desktop and both APK build jobs PASS; PRoot and physical ARM64 still NOT VERIFIED.

- 🟡 CP16 built a **QA-only clean x86_64 PRoot sidecar** with verified source hashes and ELF LOAD/RELRO 16 KiB alignment; old native executable untouched. Pending emulator proof: checkpoints/CP16/PROOT_CLEAN_CANDIDATE_20261009.md.

- 🟡 [ ] CP16 QA dependency isolation: CI 37914967175 demonstrated missing talloc_enable_leak_report in QA PRoot linker. New clean, privately linked talloc candidate awaiting Android emulator verification. Production and UI untouched; not release-ready. See checkpoints/CP16/PROOT_CLEAN_CANDIDATE_20261009.md.

- ✅ [x] **CP16 QA-only native PRoot x86_64 emulator PASS:** Android 36 run 38004055930 executed a fixed Alpine BusyBox guest command under app UID using clean candidate ELF and talloc; all four CI jobs passed. Evidence: checkpoints/CP16/PROOT_QA_PASS_38004055930.md.
- ⬜ [ ] **CP16 production PRoot and physical ARM64:** NOT VERIFIED. Existing production ELF/loader unchanged, PTY/agent workflows and 16 KiB physical runtime untested. PR #1 remains draft.

- [x] Resolved CI 38398293447 native-tool timeout: the corrected revision passed all 84 tests and all four jobs in CI 38399249491; every hash/symbol/alignment assertion retained.

- [x] Corrected full CI 38399249491 retained every ELF hash/dependency/symbol/alignment check; bounded 15000 ms tool deadline resolved the shared-runner timeout.

- [x] CI 38405598188 probe mismatch resolved: compare complete chat histories, not sibling live telemetry. Four negative controls retain message/room protection; corrected CI 38406779812 passes without HTTP policy relaxation.

- [x] Corrected Android history assertion excludes live status telemetry only; all message/room equality checks remain enforced in CI 38406779812.
